##Game rules
Protect your base by shooting bullets(press space) at incoming enemies! Prepare to dodge enemy bullets by using the up and down key. 
Player tank has a health level of 50 and it will be depleted when hit, so make sure to stay alive!
Only in 'Hard game world' is there a yellow powerup that can be picked up. It will transform the player tank into a super tank. 
Super tank functions: Shoot bullets faster, bullets can go through multiple enemies, the tank will become invincible, lastly the powerup will only last 5 seconds once picked up.
